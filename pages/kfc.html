How to Make KFC Fried Chicken
Equipment
One thing is decidedly different between a homemade KFC recipe and KFC chicken purchased in a restaurant, and that is pressure cooking. To get it just right, you need a chicken pressure fryer.

Frying under pressure enables faster cooking at lower oil temps than in a conventional deep fryer. Using a pressure fryer ensures that moisture and flavor are sealed in while excess cooking oil is sealed out. This method produces a healthier and juicier chicken made with a Kentucky fried chicken recipe. 

However, you probably don’t have a commercial pressure fryer sitting on your countertop, so you can use a regular deep fryer or even a Dutch oven.

Just in case you don’t have a deep fryer or Dutch oven, you can get the equipment you need on Amazon in order to make the recipe:
